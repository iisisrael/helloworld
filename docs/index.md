How It Started
==============

I've long thought that web application developers, including myself, should have web application resumes as demontrative representations of their abilities in some way.  I've not often needed a resume.  So I never got around to following through on that idea myself, until one day I got an itch to try making something using React.

How It's Going
==============

I went far enough to feel like I got the gist of React, though I don't claim anything like proficiency.  It's not a library I use much every day.  In fact, I don't engineer much in the way of code day to day, as my current role has shifted into management.

What It Is Now
==============

It's still intended to function as my resume.  However, as the skillset I wish to exemplify has morphed, the manner in which I want to maintain this project has shifted as well.  Wouldn't it be neat if I can engage other engineers to contribute?  In this way, I'll be putting my own skills to use, while providing an opportunity for others to be recognized for their input.  If I'm successful at this, anyone should be able to fork [this project](https://github.com/iisisrael/helloworld), then personalize and publish it as their own resume.

We'll see how it goes...
